## What Does the Assessment Measure?

Our assessment evaluates four key areas that determine automation success:

**Process Readiness (35% of score)**
How much time your team spends on manual, repetitive tasks and whether your workflows are documented. Businesses with clear, repetitive processes see the fastest automation ROI.

**Technology Stack (25% of score)**
Your current tools, integration capabilities, and API availability. Modern cloud tools with open APIs are easier and cheaper to automate.

**Team Readiness (20% of score)**
How open your team is to new tools and whether leadership supports automation initiatives. Change management is often the biggest factor in automation success.

**Business Readiness (20% of score)**
Whether you have clear automation goals, budget allocated, and realistic timelines. Projects with defined objectives succeed 3x more often.
