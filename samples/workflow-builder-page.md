## How to Use the Workflow Builder

1. **Start with a template** — Choose from pre-built workflows like Client Onboarding, Invoice Processing, or Lead Qualification. Or start with a blank canvas.

2. **Add your nodes** — Drag process steps, decisions, manual tasks, and automated steps onto the canvas. Each node type is color-coded for clarity.

3. **Connect the flow** — Click and drag between node handles to create connections. Add labels to decision branches (Yes/No).

4. **Edit labels** — Click any node to rename it to match your actual process steps.

5. **Analyze for automation** — Click "Analyze" to identify which steps could be automated and get specific recommendations.

6. **Export or share** — Download your diagram as PNG for presentations, documentation, or team discussions.

## Why Map Your Workflows Before Automating?

**You can't automate what you don't understand.**

Workflow mapping helps you:

- **See the full picture** — Understand how work actually flows through your organization
- **Identify bottlenecks** — Find where work gets stuck or delayed
- **Spot redundancies** — Discover duplicate steps, unnecessary handoffs, and wasted effort
- **Document for your team** — Create clear process guides for training and consistency
- **Prioritize automation** — Know which steps to automate first based on impact
- **Estimate accurately** — Understand the full scope before investing in automation
