## How Much Does Business Automation Cost? Get Your Estimate

One of the biggest barriers to automation is uncertainty about cost. "How much will this cost?" is usually the first question—and the hardest to answer without understanding your specific needs. Our free estimator gives you a transparent ballpark based on your project scope, complexity, and support requirements.

**Get your estimate in under 2 minutes. No surprises, no hidden fees.**

## What Factors Affect Automation Pricing?

**Number of Systems to Connect**
Each system (CRM, email platform, accounting software, etc.) that needs to connect adds development time. Standard integrations with popular tools cost less than custom API work.

| Systems | Typical Range |
|---------|---------------|
| 1-2 systems | $800 - $2,000 |
| 3-4 systems | $2,000 - $5,000 |
| 5+ systems | $5,000 - $15,000+ |

**Number of Automation Steps**
The more actions, conditions, and branches in your workflow, the more development time required. A simple 3-step automation costs significantly less than a 20-step workflow with multiple decision points.

**Complexity Level**
- **Simple**: Standard integrations, basic logic, common use cases
- **Moderate**: Multiple conditions, some custom logic, error handling
- **Complex**: Advanced branching, custom transformations, extensive testing
- **Enterprise**: High volume, security requirements, SLAs, compliance

**Support Level**
- **Self-Service**: We build it, you maintain it (lowest cost)
- **Managed Setup**: We build it + 30 days of support
- **Full Service**: We build it + ongoing management (highest value)

## Our Pricing Philosophy

**Transparent**
You see exactly what you're paying for. No vague "it depends" answers. We break down costs by component so you understand the investment.

**Fixed Project Pricing**
We quote fixed prices for defined scopes. The quote is the quote—no surprise invoices at the end.

**Value-Based**
We price based on the value delivered, not hours worked. If we can deliver your $50,000/year savings in 20 hours instead of 40, you shouldn't pay more.

**No Hidden Fees**
Setup fees, maintenance costs, and ongoing support are all disclosed upfront. What you see is what you pay.
